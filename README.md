# anyAPI

**anyAPI** is a Playwright-based browser automation tool that enables you to send messages to any website and receive responses. It provides a simple interface for interacting with web applications through automated browser actions.

## Overview

anyAPI leverages [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), a powerful browser automation library, to interact with websites as a real user would. This allows you to:

- Send messages or data to any website
- Retrieve responses from web applications
- Automate complex web interactions
- Work with dynamic, JavaScript-heavy websites

## Architecture

The project uses Playwright as its core automation engine, providing:

- **Cross-browser support**: Works with Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit
- **Real browser automation**: Interacts with websites exactly as a human user would
- **JavaScript execution**: Handles modern SPAs and dynamic content
- **Network interception**: Capture and analyze requests/responses

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher recommended)
- **npm** or **yarn** package manager
